# Database operations

## Index usage review

Do not drop an index solely because `idx_scan` is zero in one snapshot. PostgreSQL
statistics reset on restart/reset and need a representative workload window.
Capture `pg_stat_user_indexes` after that window and compare index size, query
plans, uniqueness/constraint use, partial predicates, and write overhead. The
read-only report in `db/audit-index-usage.sql` lists usage and definitions and
flags exact duplicate key/predicate definitions for manual review. Preserve
indexes supporting constraints and re-check `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` for
important queries before scheduling any removal.

No production database credentials are available in this checkout, so no
index has been removed based on unobserved production usage. Run the report
against a representative deployment and attach its output before deciding on
any unused-index removal.

## Bulk export

Apply migrations before using `GET /export`. It streams newline-delimited JSON
records from the indexed data tables (API keys and secrets are excluded). The
request requires `Authorization: Bearer <key>` for an active key with explicit
export permission. Grant or revoke it with `npm run manage-keys --
grant-export <id|hash>` and `revoke-export <id|hash>`. Export traffic has its
own per-key window limit (`EXPORT_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE`, default 2) and
per-process concurrency limit (`MAX_CONCURRENT_EXPORTS`, default 2).

## Timestamp convention

All persisted instants use PostgreSQL `TIMESTAMPTZ`; application values must be
timezone-aware instants (Horizon ISO-8601 values with an offset or `Z`). Never
construct a timestamp from a timezone-free local date string. The PostgreSQL
driver returns `TIMESTAMPTZ` as JavaScript `Date`, and the API serializes it with
`toISOString()` as UTC RFC 3339 (`Z`). Database session timezone does not change
the represented instant.

## Migrations

Use `npm run migrate -- status` to inspect migration history and
`npm run migrate -- up` to apply pending migrations in filename order. Set
`RUN_MIGRATIONS_ON_STARTUP=true` on the GraphQL service to apply migrations
before it listens. A PostgreSQL advisory lock serializes concurrent runners;
the runner rejects unknown, missing, or out-of-order history. Migration SQL
must record its own filename stem in `schema_migrations` (as existing migration
files do).
